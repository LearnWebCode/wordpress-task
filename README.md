You can use [Local WP](https://localwp.com/) to create a local development environment on your computer. It is what I use and recommend for local WordPress development.

Then, in any local WP project; go into the project's `app/public/wp-content/themes` folder and place the folder/files from this repository as a new theme folder in that `themes` folder.

Then, open that theme folder up in VS Code, run the `npm install` command, and then the `npm run start` command and begin working while it runs in the background and watches your files for CSS class names. Enjoy!
